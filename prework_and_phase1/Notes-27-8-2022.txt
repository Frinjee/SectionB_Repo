 - if, then, else

 - do, while

 - fi

- time
    causes timing statistics to be printed for the pipeline once it finishes
- { }
    Code in '{}' is executed in the current thread/process/environment and changes are preserved, to put it more succinctly, the code is run in the current scope

find
    It “finds” files. By default, it outputs their path relative to where you ran find. But, in addition of providing you with advanced “filters” it actually allows you to run commands on each of those files


-a     
    Print all the places that contain an executable named name
-atime 
    n  File was last accessed n*x hours ago

-type f 
    -specifies type to find as file

-exec rm {}
    This variant of the -exec option runs the specified command on the selected files, but the command line is built by appending each selected file name at the end

-i
    ignore case
